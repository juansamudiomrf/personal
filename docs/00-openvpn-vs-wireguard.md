| Availability  | Yes                                           | Yes                                               | Both can operate in active-passive mode                          |
| Authentication  | With certificates                             | With certificates                                 | While both use certificates for authentication, OpenVPN often requires a more elaborate public key infrastructure due to its need for a CA (Certificate Authority) to sign the certificates. In contrast, WireGuard simplifies this process, making certificate management easier and more straightforward. WireGuard makes certificate management easier. |
| Automation    | Medium                                        | High                                              | WireGuard provides a more direct configuration, facilitating its integration into automated and orchestrated environments. On the other hand, OpenVPN may require more complex and detailed configurations, which can hinder automation. |
| Performance   | Medium                                        | High                                              | WireGuard is known for its greater efficiency and lower resource consumption compared to OpenVPN. This can result in faster connections and less impact on the underlying hardware. |
| Clients       | Linux, macOS, mobile                         | Linux, macOS, mobile                              | Both OpenVPN and WireGuard offer clients for a variety of platforms, allowing broad compatibility with popular operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and mobile devices.  |
